/*
WHAT DO WE NEED TO STORE IN VARIABLES?
- hour
- minute
- second
^ need both a js variable and a html dom variable

- function to rotate the arms
^ need one per hand?

HOW DO WE APPROACH?
- create variables in js
- write functions to console log values
- check terminal to see if it's working
- once it functions, then we'll move onto the dom
